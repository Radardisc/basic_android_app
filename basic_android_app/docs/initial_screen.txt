A Panel at the top of the screen shows the name of the application in a small font. 
Height roughly 5% of screen, but big enough to contain a 'More' button (this might be an icon in the future)

A Webview should fill the rest of the screen

The WebView should be able to have a configurable initial url, no navigation bar.

e.g.

-----
Locomas                     More    |  <---- From now on, call this I will call this the  'localmas panel'
-----



WebView
